# 🛩️ SwarmUAV: Decentralized Motion Planning for Fixed-Wing Drones

## 🧠 Overview

**SwarmUAV** implements a **decentralized swarm coordination system** for fixed-wing UAVs. It supports real-time decision-making based on local sensing and Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) to enable smooth navigation, obstacle avoidance, and group behaviors without central control.

Each UAV:
- Operates using only local sensor data
- Follows attractive and repulsive virtual forces
- Makes independent motion decisions
- Maintains separation and formation without direct communication

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ **Aggregation**: Regroup UAVs in flight  
- ✅ **Dispersion**: Spread swarm for wide-area coverage  
- ✅ **Goal Navigation**: Move toward dynamically assigned goals  
- ✅ **Split Search**: Distribute UAVs across multiple locations  
- ✅ **Scalable & Decentralized**: Works with 3 or 300+ UAVs

## 🧮 Theory: Artificial Potential Fields

Swarm coordination is based on the **Artificial Potential Field** method:

- 🟢 **Attractive Forces**: Pull UAVs toward waypoints or mission zones
- 🔴 **Repulsive Forces**: Push UAVs away from nearby agents or obstacles
- 🧭 **Resultant Vector**: Each UAV computes a net motion direction using local forces

This results in emergent group behavior without centralized control or global communication.

## 🚀 Installation
